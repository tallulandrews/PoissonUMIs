M3D - Michaelis-Menten Modelling of Dropouts for scRNASeq

This is an R package providing functions for fitting a modified Michaelis-Menten equation to the pattern of dropouts observed in a single-cell sequencing experiment and subsequent analyses including: identifying biased under-quantification of genes, and fast identification of differentially expressed genes. Visualizations are automatically produced. In addition an implementation of the algorithm presented in REFERENCE for the detection of significantly highly variable genes is included.
